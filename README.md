# Liccium Trust Engine Chrome Extension

The Liccium browser plugin will allow users to identify and verify declarations of digital media content online and perform a reverse-lookup of associated metadata, rights, and available or already acquired licences. The plugin will then verify the content's declarations, public keys, identities, and integrity using cryptographic algorithms.

The plugin will draw information from the Liccium index, which is based on content declarations on decentralised public blockchain networks, providing users with additional details about the media content and related assets.  

Overall, the Liccium browser plugin will provide a straightforward and effective way for users to verify the authenticity and accuracy of digital media content encountered while browsing the web, helping to establish trust in online publications, data, and information.
