The plugin will draw information from the Liccium index, which is based on content declarations on decentralised public blockchain networks, providing users with additional details about the media content and related assets.  

Overall, the Liccium browser plugin will provide a straightforward and effective way for users to verify the authenticity and accuracy of digital media content encountered while browsing the web, helping to establish trust in online publications, data, and information.

### Main declarations

At present, there are no declarations made on Mainnet blockchains.  

## Liccium Trust Engine

The declarations are made through the Liccium app, which is presently in its private alpha phase. For those interested in experiencing the app firsthand and joining as early adopters, you're welcome to register and request an invite code at https://Liccium.com.

**Verifiable declarations**  

With Liccium, content creators and rightsholders can digitally sign their original creative works and make publicly verifiable declarations of their original content.

Liccium helps creators and rightsholders to generate, manage, and declare content-derived identifiers (ISCC codes) for digital media content. Using ISCC, they can inseparably bind verifiable claims – e.g. rights, license, and other product metadata – to the fingerprint of their digital content. 
All declarations are automatically accessible via decentralised content registries, which allow users or machines to discover, identify, and verify the authenticity and integrity of digital media content and resolve rights, licenses, and other product metadata.

**Creator attribution**

Digital signatures and verifiable creator credentials increase trust in assertions, claims and the authenticity of the original content and help to sufficiently identify creators and rightsholders.

**ISCC**

Liccium is based on the International Standard Content Code (ISCC), a content-derived identifier, lightweight fingerprinting, and open identification system for digital media content of all media types (image, video, text, audio),  using cryptographic and similarity- preserving hashes to create a unique ID for each digital asset. 

The ISCC is on its way to global recognition – after 5 years of work, in Q1/2024, ISCC is scheduled to become a universally approved ISO standard for decentralised digital content identification. 

[Current status of the ISCC: Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 24138](https://www.iso.org/standard/77899.html)

Using a novel standard for decentralised content identification (ISCC), these claims inseparably stick with the content without relying on watermarks or embedded metadata. This empowers any user, system, or machine with access to the digital asset to independently generate an identical or similar ISCC code, enabling the identification, comparison, and matching of digital content while assessing its integrity and authenticity. 
Thus, ISCC remains dependable, retaining its full range of capabilities even in scenarios where content is altered or manipulated, or when watermarks, steganographic data, or metadata is removed from the media asset.

## Liccium Browser Plugin - Terms of Service (ToS)

> **This is the pre-release of the Liccium browser plugin and for testing purposes only!**

### Introduction

Welcome to the Liccium Browser Plugin. By using our plugin, you agree to these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.

### Usage

The Liccium Browser Plugin is designed to allow users to find and verify declarations of digital media content online. Any misuse or malicious use of the plugin is strictly prohibited.

### Verification & Authenticity

The Liccium Browser Plugin operates by capturing the URL of the online content and transmitting it to our server. This process facilitates the generation of an ISCC (International Standard Content Code) specific to the content in question. Post ISCC generation, the plugin queries the Liccium index to obtain relevant information. This index is rooted in content declarations on decentralized public blockchain networks. The derived information, including the ISCC and associated metadata, is then presented to the user, offering insights into the content's authenticity and declaration metadata.

### Privacy

We respect your privacy! The plugin does not collect any personal data. To generate the ISCC code, the URL of the content is provided temporarily to the ISCC generator service, hosted on our servers. No IP address, no URL, no content is stored!

### Limitation of Liability

While we strive to provide accurate and timely information, there may be inadvertent technical or factual inaccuracies and typographical errors. We reserve the right to make corrections and changes to the plugin at any time without notice.

### Updates

We may update our plugin and these Terms of Service from time to time. It is your responsibility to check for updates regularly.

### Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend access to our plugin for any user who violates these Terms of Service.

### Governing Law

These Terms of Service are governed by Dutch law.

### Contact
