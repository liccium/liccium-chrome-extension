# Liccium Trust Engine Chrome Extension

The Liccium browser plugin will allow users to identify and verify declarations of digital media content online and perform a reverse-lookup of associated metadata, rights, and available or already acquired licences. The plugin will then verify the content's declarations, public keys, identities, and integrity using cryptographic algorithms.

The plugin will draw information from the Liccium index, which is based on content declarations on decentralised public blockchain networks, providing users with additional details about the media content and related assets.  

Overall, the Liccium browser plugin will provide a straightforward and effective way for users to verify the authenticity and accuracy of digital media content encountered while browsing the web, helping to establish trust in online publications, data, and information.

## Liccium Browser Plugin - Terms of Service (ToS)

This is the pre-release of the Liccium browser plugin and for testing purposes only!

### Introduction

Welcome to the Liccium Browser Plugin. By using our plugin, you agree to these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.

### Usage

The Liccium Browser Plugin is designed to allow users to find and verify declarations of digital media content online. Any misuse or malicious use of the plugin is strictly prohibited.

### Verification & Authenticity

The Liccium Browser Plugin operates by capturing the URL of the online content and transmitting it to our server. This process facilitates the generation of an ISCC (International Standard Content Code) specific to the content in question. Post ISCC generation, the plugin queries the Liccium index to obtain relevant information. This index is rooted in content declarations on decentralized public blockchain networks. The derived information, including the ISCC and associated metadata, is then presented to the user, offering insights into the content's authenticity and declaration metadata.
